  <h2>What are SVG Graphics<h2>
      <h4><p style="text-align: left;"> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999. All major modern web browsers—including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Microsoft Edge—have SVG rendering support. </p><h4>
      <h4><p style="text-align: left;"> SVG Graphics was developed by the W3C SVG Working Group starting in 1998, after six competing vector graphics submissions were received that year

 <h2>What is the Purpose of SVG Graphics?
      <h4><p style="text-align: left;"> Scalability. One the major benefits of SVG is that they are resolution independent. This means that unlike file types such as JPG or PNG, SVGs retain the same quality no matter what screen resolution or size they are being at.

 <h2>Why It's Better Than PNG anmd JPG
      <h4><p style="text-align: left;"> Unlike raster formats seen in JPG, GIF, and PNG, an SVG image remains crisp and clear at any resolution or size. Simply put, The most obvious difference is that SVG is a vector format, while PNG is bitmapped. You could make or edit an SVG with Adobe Illustrator, while you could make or edit a PNG with Adobe Photoshop. SVG (scalable vector graphic) Pros: resolution independent, infinitely scalable. Here are some links to images to look at the comparisons.
